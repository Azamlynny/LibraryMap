# Library Map
Software for the Clark Public Library for volunteers to be able to track which bookshelves have been sorted recently and which ones have not. This fixes the problem of volunteers not knowing which bookshelves have been sorted yet or not so that someone does not accidentally sort a bookshelf that was recently sorted.

## Features

The software allows a map as shown above be drawn using MapDrawer and then be run locally on a computer. As time progresses and a bookshelf is not sorted, the number on it increases, signifying the average amount of days all of the shelves on that bookshelf were not sorted. The color of the bookshelf becomes darker over time to help a user identify critical areas of the library.

Also, if a user hovers their mouse over a bookshelf, then the book number range of the bookshelf is shown so that a person who wants to sort a shelf could pinpoint it more easily.

By clicking on a bookshelf, each individual shelf could be seen. The shelves shown in light blue signify empty shelves. This is so that a shelf with no books on it does not contribute to the average time since last sorted. The number on each shelf tells the number of days since last sorted. Once volunteers sort a bookshelf, they hold down space (as a safety) and click on the shelves that they sorted. The program automatically saves afterwards.
