# Library Map
Software for the Clark Public Library for volunteers to be able to track which bookshelves have been sorted recently and which ones have not. This fixes the problem of volunteers not knowing which bookshelves have been sorted yet or not so that someone does not accidentally sort a bookshelf that was recently sorted.
